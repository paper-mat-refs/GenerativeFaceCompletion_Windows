# GenerativeFaceCompletion_Windows
This repository presents the windows version of the Caffe for training and testing GenerativeFaceCompletion code (Yijunmaverick/GenerativeFaceCompletion)

[Yijunmaverick]() presented the MatCaffe implementation of their [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Li_Generative_Face_Completion_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) at this [repo](https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/GenerativeFaceCompletion). Their code can directly be run on linux after installing the Caffe version. The official [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/windows) version of windows is slightly different from the [Caffe](https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/GenerativeFaceCompletion/tree/master/include/caffe) version used by FaceCompletion, so the windows version of Caffe can not be used directly to do Face completion experiments on windows platform.

This repository contains the modified version of windows-Caffe. One can clone the repo on their windows system and start doing experiments with GenerativeFaceCompletion.
